# Tableau_dashboard_project
I built a Tourism Dashboard in Tableau using Excel data. It shows key metrics like total tourists, revenue, profit, and average spend per tourist. With filters for year, region, season, and tour type, plus maps and trend charts, it helps analyze tourism performance and insights easily.
